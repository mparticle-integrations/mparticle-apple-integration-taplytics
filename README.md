## Taplytics Kit Integration

This repository contains the [Taplytics](https://www.taplytics.com) integration for the [mParticle Apple SDK](https://github.com/mParticle/mparticle-apple-sdk).

### Adding the integration

1. Add the kit dependency to your app's Podfile:

    ```
    pod 'mParticle-Taplytics', '~> 8.0'
    ```

2. Follow the mParticle iOS SDK [quick-start](https://github.com/mParticle/mparticle-apple-sdk), then rebuild and launch your app, and verify that you see `"Included kits: { Taplytics }"` in your Xcode console

> (This requires your mParticle log level to be at least Debug)

3. Reference mParticle's integration docs below to enable the integration.
